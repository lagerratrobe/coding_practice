<h1>HTML Sample</h1>

<p>HTML stands for "Hypertext Markup Language" where the "Markup" are in-line formatting instructions that tell a browser how something should look.</p>

<p>These markup instructions are called "tags" and have a beginning and an end.  For example, if you want to make a section of text bold, you wrap it in "bold" tags.
  <b>This is bold text.</b>
</p>
